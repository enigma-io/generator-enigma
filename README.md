- Code quality assessment & style enforcement via [ESLint](http://eslint.org/)
- SCSS -> CSS compilation via [Pleeease](http://pleeease.io/) + [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer)
- Unit testing via the [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) framework and [Jasmine2](http://jasmine.github.io/2.0/introduction.html) test runner

### Usage

**To set up a new app, create a folder, enter it and run `yo enigma`**

The generator will ask a few questions and insert the prebuilt skeleton for a typical React-based webapp. Then you're rolling!

Once you've set up your app, check out the targets available in `package.json`. The conveniences available at `npm run <target>`:

- `build`: Compiles your application JS (with sourcemapping -- good for debugging) to `dist/bundle.js`
- `release`: Compiles and minifies your application JS (without sourcemapping) to `dist/bundle.min.js`
- `start`: Compiles your app and boots up a livereload server -- just make changes to your files (JS, SCSS, etc.)
- `test`: Runs your unit tests. (will automatically include any file inside of folders named `__tests__`)
- `lint`: Checks your project for JS code style, according to the rules in `.eslintrc`

### Testing

The [Jasmine 2](http://jasmine.github.io/2.0/introduction.html) test runner is included by default, as a part of the [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) unit testing framework.
