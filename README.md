Scaffolding for automation of basic tooling and tasks typically required by React projects, including:

- CommonJS module bundling via [Browserify](http://browserify.org/)
- ES2015 syntax support and transpilation via [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)
- Code quality assessment & style enforcement via [ESLint](http://eslint.org/)
- [Stylus](http://stylus-lang.com/) CSS preprocessing & automatic vendor prefix management via [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer#autoprefixer-)
- Unit testing via the [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) framework and [Jasmine2](http://jasmine.github.io/2.0/introduction.html) test runner

---

### Installation

```bash
npm i -g generator-enigma
```

The build script will automatically try to install Yeoman for you if it isn't installed already. Alternatively, you can do this yourself via

```bash
npm i -g yo
```

### Usage

**To set up a new app, create a folder, enter it and run `yo enigma`**

The generator will ask a few questions and insert the prebuilt skeleton for a typical React-based webapp. Then you're rolling!

Once you've set up your app, check out the targets available in `package.json`. The conveniences available at `npm run <target>`:

- `build`: Compiles your application JS (with sourcemapping -- good for debugging) to `dist/assets/bundle.js` and style files (with sourcemapping) to `dist/assets/style.css`

- `release`: Compiles and minifies your application JS (without sourcemapping) to `dist/assets/bundle.min.js` and style files (without sourcemapping) to `dist/assets/style.min.css` - the intent is you should be able to copy the contents of `dist` to a server and have it work without modification

- `start`: Compiles your app and boots up a livereload server -- just make changes to your files (JS, Stylus/CSS, etc.)
- `test`: Runs your unit tests. (will automatically include any file inside of folders named `__tests__`)
- `lint`: Checks your project for JS code style, according to the rules in `.eslintrc`

### Testing

The [Jasmine 2](http://jasmine.github.io/2.0/introduction.html) test runner is included by default, as a part of the [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) unit testing framework.

Jest's [automocking functionality](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/automatic-mocking.html) is disabled in `jest.setup.js`. We've found this dramatically reduces the complexity of writing tests, but you can choose to enable it if desired by commenting out the `jest.autoMockOff()` line.

To collect coverage information, include the following in your package.json's "jest" property:

```json
"collectCoverage": true,
"collectCoverageOnlyFrom": {
  "example/index.js": true
}
```

Add the files you wish to acquire coverage for to the list in `jest.collectCoverageOnlyFrom`. The framework is supposed to support globbing, but there is a [bug](https://github.com/facebook/jest/issues/632) and only specifically-mentioned files work at this time.
